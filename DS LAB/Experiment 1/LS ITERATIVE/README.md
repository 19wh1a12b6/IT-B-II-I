# LINEAR SEARCH ITERATIVE

## AIM OF THE EXPERIMENT : To find the key element using linear search iterative method.

### DESCRIPTION : In computer science, a linear search or sequential search is a method for finding an element within a list. It sequentially checks each element of the list until a match is found or the whole list has been searched.

#### STEP BY STEP PROCEDURE : 

1.In this method, the searching begins from the first element or record. The required key value is compared with the record key. Searching continues sequentially till the record with a matching key value is found or if the data ends.

2.Take the input array arr[] from user.

3.Take element(x) you want to search in this array from user.

4.Set flag variable as -1

5.LOOP : arr[start] -> arr[end]

  1.if match found i.e arr[current_postion] == x then

   Print “Match Found at position” current_position.
 
   flag = 0
 
   abort

6.After loop check flag variable.
    
   1.if flag == -1
 
   print “No Match Found”

7.STOP
