# LINEAR SEARCH RECURSIVE

## AIM OF THE EXPERIMENT : To find the key value, using linear search recursive meathod

### DESCRIPTION : a linear search or sequential search is a method for finding an element within a list. It sequentially checks each element of the list until a match is found or the whole list has been searched

#### STEP BY STEP PROCEDURE :

1.Start from the leftmost element of arr[] and one by one compare x with each element of arr[]

2.If x matches with an element, return the index.

3.If x doesnâ€™t match with any of elements, return -1.

OUTPUTS :
 
 KEY VALUE (36) - The key value 36 is in the list, it is found in the posituon 4.
 
 KEY VALUE (100) - The key value 100 is not found in the list, position is not dislpayed.
